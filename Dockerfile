# npm is only needed to install dependencies. It is removed right after, so
# the final image doesn't ship it: the npm bundled in node:20-alpine carries a
# vulnerable tar (CVE-2026-59873) that fails the pipeline's scan-image job,
# and the container never uses npm at runtime (CMD runs node directly).
